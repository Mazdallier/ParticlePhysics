Particle Physics
===============
Particle Physics is being split off from Minechem. If you're upgrading to ParticlePhysics from Minechem pre-5.0.5-Dev4, please read about [how to upgrade](http://jakimfett.com/status-report/splitting-minechem/).

You can [download the latest Particle Physics builds from Jenkins](http://jenkins.jakimfett.com/build/job/ParticlePhysics/). Please report any bugs, and be aware that Particle Physics isn't quite stable yet.

The basic principles can be seen in [BevoLJ's showcase of Minechem and Particle Physics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=V_J7eruam9A#t=1058).

Pixlepix's original idea:
>While playing Unleashed, I realized I had a problem. There was no interesting way to generate power. All generation methods were simply put in fuel -> get out power, or build solar panel -> get out power.
>
>Instead I built/still am building a mod that lets you mess around and have fun to create a unique power plant. Basic Particles: First, craft an emitter. Right click it with fuel to create particles(It can also be supplied via automation). 
>Each type of fuel creates a different type of particle. At present, you can make particles using: Coal, Clay, Seeds, Sand, Blazepowder, charcoal, glass, leaves, paper and Gunpowder. Particles are emitted from all four sides of an emitter and travel in a straight line. They will die upon contact with a block. In order to turn them, place a block of glass in their path.
